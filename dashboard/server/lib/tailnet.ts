 * the tailnet. Public names are unaffected, which is why node discovery kept
 * working after the move to k3s while the launcher's health checks did not.
 *
 * Reconfiguring the pod's DNS would trade a red tile for the risk of no DNS at
 * all. The addresses are already in hand here, so anything that needs to reach
 * a tailnet name by name can ask for one instead.
 *
 * Keyed on the MagicDNS label rather than on the reported hostname. The two
 * agree only while Tailscale has never had to disambiguate: delete and re-add
 * a machine — which is exactly what the documented Uptime Kuma rollback does —
 * and two devices report the hostname `uptime` while MagicDNS calls the second
 * `uptime-1`. On the hostname the pair collide and last-write-wins decides,
 * silently, whether the tile probes the live proxy or the dead one. The label
 * is unique by construction, and it is what the URL being resolved actually
 * contains.
 *
 * Rebuilt rather than merged so a machine that goes away takes its address
 * with it. Merging left a deleted proxy's 100.x in the map forever, and under
 * the systemd install — where MagicDNS does resolve — that turned a working
 * lookup into a connection to an address nothing answers on.
