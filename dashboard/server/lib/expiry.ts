/**

 * There is one today. Under systemd the server asked the local tailscaled
 * socket which machines exist, and a socket does not expire. A pod has no
 * socket, so it carries a Tailscale API key instead, and Tailscale caps those
 * at ninety days.
 *
 * The failure is silent, which is the whole reason this file exists. On the
 * day the key lapses /api/nodes starts answering 502 and the fleet empties,
 * while both the readiness and liveness probes go on checking a static path
 * that keeps returning 200. Kubernetes calls the pod healthy throughout.
 *
 * The date cannot be discovered from the key: Tailscale will not tell a token
 * when it dies, and asking for the tailnet's key list needs a scope this one
 * deliberately does not have. So the installer records the date beside the key
 * in the same Secret, and this reads it back.
