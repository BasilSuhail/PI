# This is its background loop, not the request rate: it rebuilds every enabled
# plugin on this timer whether or not anyone is asking. On pi1 that means a
# 189-process list plus a Docker stats call for six containers.
#
# Do not oversell what this saves. Glances costs about 0.4% of one core on pi1,
# measured over a 50 second window against the board's own clock, which agrees
# with the 0.54% recorded in issue #1. The reason to do it is that the work is
# needless, not that the board is drowning in it.
#
# Five rather than the two it used to be. The console polls every three seconds
# and now holds its own answer for 2.5, so nothing downstream can tell the
# difference on the meters, and the collector does 60% less work to feed them.

# `ip` does an outbound lookup of the public address. `ports` probes hosts on a

# whole process list a second time, on top of the one that is already the most
# expensive thing here. `folders` walks directories. None of it reaches the
# dashboard: temperature comes from the pi-metrics shim reading sysfs directly,
# and disk figures come from `fs`.
