# Makes a plugged-in drive mount itself. Run on any board. Idempotent.
#
# Plugging a disk in should be the whole job — USB, SATA, whatever the kernel
# recognises. Without this it takes an ssh session, a mount, an fstab line and
# a re-run of setup-browse.sh, which is four steps too many for "I attached a
# drive".
#
# A udev rule hands each new partition to systemd-mount, which mounts it under
# /media and unmounts it again when the device goes away. That is how a desktop
# Linux behaves; nothing here is exotic. /media is already in the agent's
# writable roots, so the drive arrives browsable and writable with no config.
#
# The partitions the board boots from are excluded explicitly, by device and by
# PARTUUID. The first version of this rule trusted systemd-mount to skip
# devices already in fstab, and that trust was wrong: fstab names them by
# PARTUUID while the rule hands systemd-mount a /dev node, and both boards
# ended up with their own root and boot filesystems mounted under /media —
# writable, through the console's file browser, one stray delete from an
# unbootable board.

cat <<'NOTE'

  A drive without a filesystem label mounts under its device name instead —
  "sda1" rather than "photos" — so label one if you would rather read the name
  than decode it:

      sudo e2label /dev/sdX1 photos          ext4
      sudo exfatlabel /dev/sdX1 photos       exFAT
      sudo fatlabel /dev/sdX1 PHOTOS         FAT32

  Removable drives mount the moment they are plugged in and appear under
  "2) Plugged in" in the share, and as a disk of their own in the console.
  Fixed disks still mount on first access, so a sleeping drive is not spun up
  just because something listed a directory.

  This does not touch the disks the board already had. Those stay in fstab and
  stay where they are.
