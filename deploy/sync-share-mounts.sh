# One pass at making the Finder mounts match what the tailnet can reach right
# now: mount what is missing, unmount what has gone stale. Runs on the Mac, on
# an interval, from the agent that deploy/install-share-mounts.sh sets up.
#
# Nothing is remembered between passes. The mount table and `tailscale status`
# are the two sources of truth; a third opinion kept in a file here would only
# be one more thing to go stale.
#
# Nothing here may block. launchd will not start a second copy of an agent that
# is still running, so a pass that hangs does not miss one beat — it is the last
# pass that ever runs, and it hangs holding the very mount it was supposed to
# clear. Every operation that touches a mount point is therefore either bounded
# or pushed into the background and abandoned.
#
# Mounting goes through NetFS, not mount_smbfs. mount_smbfs takes a password
# from a terminal and nothing else: it opens /dev/tty and ignores stdin, so it
# works when a person is sitting there to type and never works from an agent.
# That is not a detail — it is the whole reason an earlier version of this file
# logged an authentication error every fifteen seconds for hours while the
# stored password was perfectly correct. NetFS takes the credential as a
# parameter, which is what an unattended mount needs.
