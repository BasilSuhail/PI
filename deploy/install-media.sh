# Jellyfin and Kiwix, and moves Vaultwarden and Uptime Kuma onto the same
# storage layout. Runs on the board.
#
# One idea, applied four times: an app has two halves, and they belong on
# different drives for different reasons.
#
#   APPS_DIR   the SSD. Everything the computer reads at random: settings,
#              databases, caches, artwork, indexes. Small, and the part where
#              speed is felt — a seek costs a spinning disk about 5ms against
#              an SSD's 0.1, and a database is thousands of seeks.
#   DATA_DIR   the 6TB. Everything you would recognise as a file: films and
#              .zim archives. Large, read start to finish, which is what a
#              spinning disk is actually good at.
#
# The cut is by how a file is read, not by whether it is called data. Calling a
# database "data" and putting it on the big disk is the mistake this layout was
# one revision away from making: Jellyfin's library index is 50MB and would
# have made the whole interface feel slow from the far side of a seek.
#
# Both are overridable, which is the point:
#
#     DATA_DIR=/srv/storage/media bash deploy/install-media.sh
#
# Nothing here uses a PersistentVolumeClaim. k3s' local-path provisioner puts
# volumes in /var/lib/rancher/k3s/storage/pvc-<uuid>_<ns>_<name>, and a
# directory named after a UUID inside a container runtime's internals cannot
# be found in Finder, cannot be backed up without knowing k3s, and cannot tell
# you what is eating the disk. Named directories on named drives do all three.

Jellyfin
  Open it and run the setup wizard. Add a library pointing at /media/Movies
  and /media/Shows — those are ${DATA_DIR}/Jellyfin/Media/* from the board.
  Copy films in through the HDD-6TB folder in Finder.

  This board direct-plays. It does not meaningfully transcode: a client that
  needs the video re-encoded will stutter, and 4K will not work at all. Play
  to something that handles the codec natively and it is fine.

Kiwix
  Serving an empty catalogue until there is something to serve. Download a
  .zim from https://download.kiwix.org/zim/ into ${DATA_DIR}/Kiwix, then:

    sudo k3s kubectl -n jug rollout restart deployment/kiwix

  The library is rebuilt from whatever is in that folder on every start, so
  the folder is the truth and there is no index to keep in step with it.

Rollback:  sudo k3s kubectl -n jug delete -f ${REPO_ROOT}/k8s/jellyfin.yaml -f ${REPO_ROOT}/k8s/kiwix.yaml
