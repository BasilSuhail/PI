# was corrupted three times by one: a stale Immich in another namespace
# (`jug`) whose Postgres mounted the same folder as the live one. Postgres's
# lock file does not stop that — in a container both postmasters are PID 1,
# so each takes the other's lock for its own — and nothing else did either.

# Refused when a Deployment, StatefulSet or DaemonSet in ANOTHER namespace
#   - has the same name as one being installed, or
#   - mounts the same host folder.
# Same-namespace sharing is left alone: that is Nextcloud showing Immich's
# folder read-only, not a second Immich. /dev is not data (qBittorrent's
# /dev/net/tun), so it never counts.
