# Stop the wifi radio going to sleep between packets. Runs on the board.
#
# Measured, not guessed. Streaming a film off jug2 stutters a few times an
# hour while every other number says the board is idle: CPU under 6%, load
# under 0.7, 48 C, never throttled, Jellyfin itself under 0.5% of one core.
# Sampling the link every five seconds for ten minutes found the cause:
#
#   116 pings, zero lost
#   median 6.6ms, p90 7.8ms, p99 13.3ms
#   one outlier at 101ms
#
# That shape is specific. A congested link drops packets and this one dropped
# none. A loaded board raises latency gradually and this one did not. A single
# large spike with everything around it clean is the radio not being there for
# a moment, which is what power saving does: the chip sleeps between beacons
# and the first packet after a sleep waits for it to wake.
#
# It matters here and not on a laptop because the board is a server. Nothing
# it serves is ever the thing that woke the radio up.
#
# NetworkManager is the owner of the setting on Debian 13, so the drop-in
# below is the durable half and survives reboots and reconnections. `iw` is
# the immediate half, because the drop-in only takes effect the next time the
# connection comes up and nobody wants to reboot a board to stop a stutter.
