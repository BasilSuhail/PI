#   DATA_DIR   the 6TB. The photos and videos themselves — large, written

# Both are overridable:

# Safe to re-run. The database password is generated on the first run and
# never regenerated: rotating it after Postgres has initialised gives a
# server that cannot log into its own database, with an authentication error
# that reads like a bug.

Immich keeps its two halves on two disks.

  This folder      $APPS_DIR/Immich
                   The Postgres database and the downloaded model weights.
                   Small, read at random, so it lives on the SSD.

  Your photos      $DATA_DIR/Immich
                   Everything you uploaded. Large, so it lives on the 6TB.

The photos are plain files. The database holds albums, faces and the search
index — losing it costs those, not the pictures.

Set by deploy/install-immich.sh. Both paths move with APPS_DIR= or DATA_DIR=.

Next, in this order:

  1. Open the URL above. The first account you create is the admin, and
     Immich closes sign-up behind it on its own.

  2. Move the three schedules off the middle of the night. All of them are in
     Administration > Settings, and all of them default to midnight or 2am:

       Nightly Tasks     start time      00:00  ->  06:00
       External Library  scan cron     0 0 * * *  ->  0 6 * * *
       Backup            database cron 0 02 * * *  ->  off

     The third is a scheduled database dump. Nothing else on these boards is
     backed up on a schedule, so it is a decision rather than a default. It
     dumps the database only — albums, faces and the search index, not the
     photos.

  3. Set the storage template, under Administration > Settings > Storage
     Template, so the library stays readable from outside Immich:

       {{y}}/{{MM}}/{{filename}}

     Without it the tree is nested by asset id, and the folder on the 6TB
     stops being something you can walk in Finder.

  4. Install the Immich app on the phone and point it at the URL above.
     Tailscale has to be up on the phone or it reaches nothing.

     Background App Refresh is optional. With it off, the app uploads
     everything new each time you open it, which is the reliable path anyway —
     iOS decides when background tasks run, and the app cannot ask.

  5. For an existing library, do not push it through the phone. From the Mac:

       npx @immich/cli upload --recursive /path/to/photos

     It asks for the server URL and an API key, which you make under Account
     Settings > API Keys. Originals are read, never moved or altered.

Machine learning is queued per upload, not continuous and not at search time.
A first bulk import will keep the CPU busy for as long as it takes and then
stop. Watch it under Administration > Jobs.
