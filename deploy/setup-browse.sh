# Builds /srv/browse — one folder per drive. Nothing else at the top.
#
# This is "This PC" on Windows and the Locations list in Finder: a machine has
# drives, the drives are what you open, and anything that is not a drive has no
# business sitting beside them. Two disks in jug2 means two folders. Plug in a
# third and there are three. That is the whole model.
#
#   SSD-1TB      the disk, whole: "1) Archive" first, then the OS — bin, boot,
#                etc, and the rest of what a Linux install has. A disk that
#                hides its own /etc is a brochure, not a view.
#   HDD-6TB      the other disk.
#
# The archive is inside the disk that holds it, named so it sorts to the top of
# that disk's own listing — digits before letters. It is not a folder at the
# top level: the top level is drives.
#
# Bind mounts, not symlinks: Samba refuses to follow a symlink out of a share
# unless `wide links = yes`, and that option turns off a protection worth
# keeping. A bind mount is the same thing without the hole.
#
# One trap the shape has to defuse, learned the hard way: a mount under a bound
# root is invisible through the bind — the bind shows the directory underneath,
# not the filesystem mounted on it. So a second filesystem on the SAME disk
# (the boot partition) is bound again inside the disk's folder, at its real
# path. A filesystem on a DIFFERENT disk is deliberately not: /srv/storage on
# the SSD holds none of the SSD, the HDD has a folder of its own at the top,
# and the empty directory the SSD really has there is the truthful thing to
# show.
#
# Nothing here formats, partitions or writes to a disk. Idempotent: re-run it
# after mounting anything new and the tree is rebuilt to match.
