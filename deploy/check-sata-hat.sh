# monitor attached to read the panic on. So it prints the line to add and
# leaves the decision, and the reboot, to a person.
#
# The HAT moved from jug1 to jug2 and has never been checked in its new slot.
# With nothing plugged into it the expected answer is a SATA controller on the
# bus holding no disks — that still proves the port is on and the HAT is seated,
# which is everything worth knowing before a drive and a 12V supply arrive.
