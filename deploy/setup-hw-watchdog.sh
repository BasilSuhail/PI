# The board's hardware watchdog: if this board hangs, the chip reboots it.
# Runs on the board. Idempotent: re-running with the same timeout changes
# nothing.
#
# systemd, as PID 1, pats the SoC's watchdog timer every few seconds. If the
# kernel or systemd locks up, the patting stops, and once RuntimeWatchdogSec
# passes the chip resets the board — no person, no other board. Costs nothing:
# no daemon, no memory, a timer write every few seconds from a process that
# runs anyway.
#
# Why: jug2 went off the network on 2026-10-03 and stayed off for 16 hours
# until it was unplugged. Power, memory and heat were ruled out afterwards;
# a hang fits (#187).
#
# What it does not cover, so nobody expects it to:
#   - A board that has lost power, or shut itself down. Nothing is running to
#     reboot it; only cutting and restoring the power does that.
#   - A hang where the kernel and systemd still run — a wedged disk, a dead
#     network driver — because systemd keeps patting.
#
