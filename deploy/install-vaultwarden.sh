Next, in this order:

  1. Open the URL above and create your account. Use a strong, different
     master password: this vault is not the one you already have.

  2. Import the copy. In Bitwarden, Tools > Export vault, format .json.
     Then here, Tools > Import data, "Bitwarden (json)". Delete the export
     file afterwards, it is plain text.

  3. Close registration, so nobody else can make an account:

       sudo k3s kubectl -n pi patch configmap vaultwarden-config \
         --type merge -p '{"data":{"SIGNUPS_ALLOWED":"false"}}'
       sudo k3s kubectl -n pi rollout restart deployment/vaultwarden

Attachments do not come across in a JSON export, and neither do Sends or
password history. Everything else, including TOTP codes, does.
